This work proposes a novel dual formulation of the **Generalized Sinkhorn distance-regularized DRO** problem and introduces a **Nested Stochastic Gradient Descent (Nested SGD) algorithm** with provable convergence guarantees.

In this repository, we provide **PyTorch implementations** of our method along with several baseline algorithms.
